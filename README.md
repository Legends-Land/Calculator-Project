## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure
- **CSS3** – dark-themed styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – logic for input, operations, and output

## 💡 How It Works

- Buttons are rendered with classes (`number`, `operator`, `equals`, etc.)
- `eval()` is used to calculate results when `=` is pressed
- `C` clears the input field
- Input field is read-only to ensure button-only entry

## 📦 Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-2.git
